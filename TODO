# To do

### Backlog

* Noticed some issues once pipeline completed - tame and tmu being deleted from environment but not midas. midas tables present at pipeline completion only has 6 variables. Outputted csvs still as expected.
* Date handling, limits exceeded causes UI timeout. Switch to shiny server handling instead.
* Investigate new api
* include number of records with head preview
* defer to user - ability to specify single dates to test on?
* defer to user - pattern cleansing,   pattern = "souhbound", replacement = "southbound", script 13.
* Adjust table outputs, smaller max-size etc.
* defer to user - site status - active / inactive context.
* defer to user - splitting of combo output csvs by sitetype or by number of rows.
* Navbar menu styling
* Date checks in app- daterange selection instead?
* Remove all missing report.txt logic or move to logs.
* Remove busy spinner & replace with progress bar, updating pipeline with progress object.
* Persistent Email storage between sessions locally.



### Performance

* 2 days (1st to 2nd Sep 2020) takes: Time difference of 5.679 mins, 3.6 times faster using parallel compute.
* Scale up to 1 month, previously took 2.25 hrs for Sep 2020.
* Queried 31 days for all sites in Time difference of 52.702 mins
* 2.6 times faster using parallel compute. Comes at a cost though - requires additional RAM, from 20GB up to 30GB.
