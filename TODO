# To do

### Backlog

* v1.3 causing crashes on full month runs. Seems to error out in script 8. Investigate, roll back to v1.2 in the meantime.
* Have noticed memory issues on re-run. Investigate clearing out environmental objects on re-runs, eg if midas %in% ls(), rm(midas). Same for TAME & TMU.
* Above issue appears to be resolved, though dates not being read from rds on certain re-run conditions. Need to investigate. Script 3 logging.
* errors caused on multiple runs, image in docs/images/error-2.png
* Update documentation
* Tidy up environment from final sequential script forwards.
* Date checks in app- daterange selection instead?
* Remove all missing report.txt logic or move to logs.
* Remove busy spinner & replace with progress bar, updating pipeline with progress object.
* sendCustomMessage modal is appearing several times on re-runs in session.
* Persistent Email storage between sessions locally.
