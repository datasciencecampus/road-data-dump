# To do

### Backlog

* possible to use conditional logic in selected value of dateRangeInput? eg, if testing,
diplay test date else display today's date.
* defer to user - ability to specify single dates to test on?
* defer to user - pattern cleansing,   pattern = "souhbound", replacement = "southbound", script 13.
* defer to user - site status - active / inactive context.
* defer to user - splitting of combo output csvs by sitetype or by number of rows.
* Remove all missing report.txt logic or move to logs.
* Remove busy spinner & replace with progress bar, updating pipeline with progress object.
* Persistent Email storage between sessions locally.
* Max-width on table previews required. Table columns spilling into adjacent UI column. Tried css: width: 83% !important; not working, tried with '.middleTable' & '.middleTable table' selectors.

* Queried 31 days for all sites in Time difference of 52.702 mins
