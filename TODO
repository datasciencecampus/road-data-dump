# To do

### Backlog

* Update documentation
* Tidy up environment from final sequential script forwards.
* Date checks in app- daterange selection instead?
* Remove all missing report.txt logic or move to logs.
* Implement partial data dump logic, when the cache file is partially populated due to an interrupted run, it would be more efficient to compare cached daily reports already ingested against those that are still outstanding. Pick up where we left off.
* Persistent Email storage between sessions locally.

* Scale up to 1 month, previously took 2.25 hrs for Sep 2020.
* Queried 31 days for all sites in Time difference of 52.702 mins
